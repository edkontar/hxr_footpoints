In the thick-target approximation, the electron flux spectrum versus distance can be written
\[
F(E, s)=F_0\left(E_0\right) \frac{E}{E_0}
\]
where $F_0(E)$ is the injected spectrum of energetic electrons, taken to be a power law of $F_0(E) \propto E^{-\delta}$ and
\[
E_0(E, s)^2=E^2+2 K \int_0^s n\left(s^{\prime}\right) d s^{\prime}
\]

where $K=2 \pi e^2 \ln \Lambda, \ln \Lambda$ is the Coulomb logarithm, and $e$ is the electron charge. The chromosphere can be conveniently assumed to be neutral (Brown 1973; Kontar et al. 2002), therefore $\ln \Lambda=\ln \Lambda_{e H}=7$ (e.g., Brown 1973; Emslie 1978).

The X-ray flux spectrum emitted by the energetic electrons in a magnetic flux tube of cross-sectional area $A$ and observed at 1 AU is given as

\[
I(\epsilon, s)=\frac{1}{4 \pi R^2} A n(s) \int_\epsilon^{\infty} F(E, s) \sigma(E, \epsilon) d E
\]
